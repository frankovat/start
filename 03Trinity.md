# Trinity - transcriptome preparation
Trinity, a RNA-seq data assembler, is available at [Metacentrum](https://wiki.metacentrum.cz/wiki/Trinity).
We will need the assembled transcriptomes for all gene prediction programs, that is why we are preparing them now.
The [trinity manual](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki/Running%20Trinity) gives you enough answers tu successfully run the program. 
However, I will be sharing with you a script from Priceton, which is easy to adjust to our computational resources.
